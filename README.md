# Resilient Response
Resilient Response is a web application developed to foster connectivity and provide vital information during periods of crisis. This application was conceived as part of the 2023 Solution Challenge, which aligns with the overarching mission to address the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals by leveraging Google technology. The Resilient Response web app offers users the ability to register and access chat interfaces to stay informed about events occurring in their geographic area. In addition to real-time weather updates, the application also displays the locations of available shelters during times of emergency.

## Let's Start Building! üß∞ 
If you wish to build this project you should make your own firebase project, and use your own firebase json. The project should be on the blaze plan, and have a realtime database, cloud functions, storage and authentication enabled.
.
In the project directory, install the dependencies and library: 

```npm install --legacy-peer-deps``` <img src="public/Building.gif" width="300" align ="right">                                      

After that, run the project:

```npm start```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm test```
